Inheritance is a common concept in our everyday lives and over the last several lessons, we saw how python implements it.
by crating a family of classes with shared behaviour while still differentiating those classes.
becasue of inheritnace we can define basic pyhon classes with large reusability along with smaller subclasses for moer detailed bahavours.
we can also take advantage of inheritance bycoding multiple non-repetitive methods that cut down on the total amount of code
needed while also cleaning and optimizing the code we do need.
we also looked at how we can use the super() function 
to inherit from and extend methods in the parent class.
finally we also looked at how we can use the super( function to inherit extended mehtods in the parent class.
